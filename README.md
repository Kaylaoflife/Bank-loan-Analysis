# Bank Loan Analysis

### Project Overview

This report was developed as part of a loan equity analysis project using 23 years of loan approval data across U.S. cities and age groups. The objective was to uncover trends, potential bias, and demographic disparities in loan approvals while providing clear business recommendations to improve fairness and strategy.

### Objectives

- Analyze loan approval patterns across demographics and locations
- Detect equity gaps in age and gender
- Evaluate product performance and customer feedback
- Provide actionable recommendations for fairer, data-driven lending practices

### Tools

  - Microsoft Power BI - Data normalization, modeling, analysis and Reporting.
  - Excel - Data exploration
 
### Tasks Performed.
#### Data Cleaning & Modeling

- Cleaned and structured raw loan data for consistency
- Built a Star Schema model including Fact and Dimension tables
- Created relationships among Customer, Feedback, Loan, Transaction, and Account tables

#### Exploratory & Diagnostic Analysis
- Analyzed loan approvals by age, gender, product type, and city
- Identified top performing loan approved,Rejected and Closed cities
- Assessed trends in customer feedback and complaint rates

#### Insight Generation & KPIs
- Calculated approval rates by segment and year
- Identified approval gaps and feedback correlation
-Flagged irregularities across cities (e.g., Mesa, Detroit, San Antonio)
  
 #### Sales performance analysis
      
- Calculated Total Sales and Quantity Sold.
- Identified Top 5 Products by Sales.
- Determined Regions with the Highest Revenue

 ### Trend analysis
 
  - Analyzed monthlysales trends.
  - Spotted seasonal spikes and low-performing months.
  - Calculated Month-on-Month (MoM) % growth

### key Findings


1. Demographic Disparities
Approval rates were highest among age groups 18–24 and 65–100, while the 45–54 group faced the highest rejection and complaint rates—indicating potential bias. 

2. Gender Equity Gaps
Despite women having a slightly higher average approval rate (33.88%), men dominated approvals in 12 of 23 years, highlighting inconsistencies.

3. Product Performance
Auto loans led in approval rates (33.36%), while mortgage loans showed the most consistent trends, revealing confusion in product targeting strategies.

4. Geographic Irregularities
Cities like San Antonio, Mesa, and Detroit displayed erratic approval patterns, suggesting a need for local-level audits.

5. Customer Feedback Insights
33.6% of all feedback was complaint-related, with middle-aged applicants submitting the most, indicating an urgent need to revisit their loan experience.

### Recommendations

1.Develop and enforce a standardized, transparent credit-scoring model applicable across all age groups to reduce bias and build trust.
2.Standardize the evaluation criteria for each loan type using a balanced view of approval rates, customer feedback, and closure trends.
3. Address the disconnect between this group’s experience and outcomes. Enhance communication, streamline application processes, and review loan terms.
4.Conduct in-depth process and performance audits in cities showing inconsistent or concerning trends to identify operational bottlenecks or policy misapplications.
5. Institute periodic, data-driven reviews of approval decisions segmented by gender to ensure fairness and compliance with DEI principles.
6. Use the high volume of customer suggestions and complaints (33.8% and 33.6%, respectively) as a resource for continuous improvement. Establish feedback loops that inform product design and customer support enhancements.
7. Address operational inconsistencies across branches and loan products through centralized oversight, unified KPIs, and consistent training.
